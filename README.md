1. black-box method in an online framework:
  the optimization method is ES
  * to run the simulation - run "make_data_stochastic_ES_elips_framework.py"
  * to produce graphs run the jupyter notebook file: "Make_graphs.ipynb"  (after the simulation finished)
  
2. ellipsoid method in an online framework:
  * to run the simulation and create the graphs - run the jupyter notebook file: "PhilipSetup.ipynb"


** note that the code files are partially documented. for further information - contact:
